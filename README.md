# Convolutional Neural Networks Study  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to studying and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for deep learning tasks. CNNs are a cornerstone of modern computer vision applications, and this study aims to provide practical insights and theoretical understanding of their inner workings.

This project covers very important topics in CNNs design, such as:  
* The architecture and layers of CNNs (Convolutional, Pooling, Fully Connected).  
* How to preprocess image datasets for use with CNNs.  
* Build and train a CNN from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.  
* Visualizing and interpreting CNN filters and feature maps.  
* Tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.  

I developed nine different models each one with specific hyperparameters configurations in order to improve the final model accuracy.
